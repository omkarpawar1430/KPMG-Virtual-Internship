### Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

-----------

**Task 1: Data Exploration Phase**
1. **Objective:** Understand the existing datasets and gain insights into customer behavior and trends.
2. **Activities:**
   - Review and explore the Customer Demographic, Customer Address, and Transactions datasets.
   - Identify and address data quality issues (missing values, inconsistencies).
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize key features and their impact on customer trends.
   - Calculate summary statistics and identify outliers.
   - Explore external data sources (ABS / Census) for potential additional variables.

**Task 2: Model Development Phase**
1. **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to identify the most valuable new customers.
2. **Activities:**
   - Define the target variable (e.g., customer value) based on business goals.
   - Perform feature engineering to create relevant predictors for the model.
   - Transform raw data fields (e.g., convert D.O.B to age or age groups).
   - Select an appropriate machine learning model (e.g., regression, classification).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimization.
   - Source external data to enhance model features if applicable.
   - Consider ensemble methods or feature importance analysis for better insights.


**Task 3: Interpretation and Reporting Phase**
1. **Objective:** Interpret model results and create a comprehensive report for client understanding.
2. **Activities:**
   - Interpret the model's output and identify key drivers of customer value.
   - Assess the impact of different features on the model predictions.
   - Validate the model's performance against business goals.
   - Create visualizations to present key findings to the client.
   - Summarize actionable insights and recommendations based on the model.
   - Prepare a detailed PowerPoint presentation outlining the approach and results.
   - Include detailed explanations of data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, and model interpretation in the presentation.
   - Present the approach to the client, seeking sign-off on the proposed strategy.
   - Address any client queries or concerns and finalize the analysis plan.
